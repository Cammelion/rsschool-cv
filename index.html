                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>My name is Artem. I’m twenty-three years old.
                    I graduated from Saratov State Technical University majoring in "Mechatronic and robotics".In
                    specialization Artificial Intelligence and Neurotechnology.</p>
                <p>When I completed my education, I understood that it was not really my cup of tea. Therefore, I
                    wanted to change the field of activity. I wanted to create an application for android to
                    practice coding.That is why I tried to learn Java for web backend and android development. Also, I
                    studied some MySQL for databases.But finally, I focused on the frontend development. In general, I
                    was
                    looking for what I liked. For the last 6-8 monthsI have been studying Frontend Development. I
                    have completed half some pet projects. I like the results and want to continue to develop in this
                    field and make it my profession.</p>
                <p>I lead a healthy lifestyle. I am quite stress-resistant, but it’s not always easy to cope with
                    stress.I like to read professional literature and fiction. I am very punctual and disciplined.I
                    have experience in writing articles and expressing my thoughts in writing. I understand that
                    teamwork
                    is essential for success in IT, but for me it usually takes time to become part of a team. I
                    sometimes tend to be a bit opinionated. At the university, I was the head of the study group, so I
                    have experience in dealing with
                    routine management tasks.</p>
                <p>As for my hobby, I have already said that I like to read, I also like to do origami and assemble
                    ship models.</p>
