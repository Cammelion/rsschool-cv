	My name is Artem. I’m twenty-three years old. 
  I graduated from Saratov State Technical University majoring in "Mechatronic and robotics".In specialization Artificial Intelligence and Neurotechnology.	
  When I completed my education, I understood that it was not really my cup of tea. Therefore, I wanted to change the field of activity. I wanted to create an application for android to practice coding.That is why I tried to learn Java for web backend and android development. Also, I studied some MySQL for databases.But finally, I focused on the frontend development. In general, I was looking for what I liked. For the last 6-8 monthsI have been studying Frontend Development. I have completed half some pet projects. I like the results and want to continue to develop in this field and make it my profession. 
  I lead a healthy lifestyle. I am quite stress-resistant, but it’s not always easy to cope with stress.I like to read professional literature and fiction. I am very punctual and disciplined.I have experience in writing articles and expressing my thoughts in writing. I understand that teamwork is essential for success in IT, but for me it usually takes time to become part of a team. I sometimes tend to be a bit opinionated. 
  At the university, I was the head of the study group, so I have experience in dealing with routine management tasks. 
  As for my hobby, I have already said that I like to read, I also like to do origami and assemble ship models.
